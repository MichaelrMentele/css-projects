Two years ago I was a Fortune 100 R&D engineer working for a critical infrastructure manufacturer on products that ship worldwide. 

I was selected to pilot a year-long program that would give me total vertical expertise in our company from manufacturing to customer support.

And I was making a bunch of money. My boss told me I would be a millionaire in stock alone within two decades.

And... that was when I knew, <i>knew</i> I couldn't stay. 

Two... <i>decades!?</i> I couldn't imagine staying there that long. It was too safe for me. Too slow. And all wrong.

See, I'd just been checking boxes. After I paid off my student loans I realized I had no real reason to be working at SEL.

In many ways Schweitzer Engineering is an awesome company. Smart. Good people. Rapidly growing...

But it doesn't matter. I'd made a bigger mistake. I'd gone into the wrong <i>field</i> altogether. I'd marched to the advice of well-meaning parents, teachers, and professors. Gotten my degree. Gotten the job. And... never taken the time to stop, research, and most importantly, <i>experiment</i> with different futures.

So I did that. I took off to Southeast Asia. Published half a book on Amazon. Tried development for Oculus. Coached football and strength training. Even did some hair modeling...

Didn't matter. Nothing seemed to fit. 

So, dejected I came back to the <i>why</i> of it all. I looked through my transcripts from college and realized my best marks were in software and digital logic. I got excited. I looked back at what I'd enjoyed most in the past and I'd always had a love for designing experiences from cooking, to writing, to being a dungeon master.

Game design seemed like a good fit so I jumped headfirst in. But I'd missed an ingredient. Meaning. How could I feel good about making games? What was I adding? Where was the value?

It's taken two years but I've learned three utterly key things:
1. I like building software and I'm good at it
2. I love building experiences and I'm good at it
3. I want to add value through meaningful work

So, I began looking around. Where could I add value? What would fit with these three criteria?

I built my first website in highschool and didn't think much of it. But coming full circle I realized I could provide value and find fulfillment in this arena.

And that is why I want to build responsive, beautiful, and intelligent applications. That is why I am a Full Stack Web Developer.
